# Challenge Name: Labyrinth
## Category: Reverse Engineering
## Difficulty : Easy

Description:

In the depths of a forgotten system, hidden among fragmented memories and corrupted file structures, lies a binary known only as **labyrinth**.
Legend says it guards an ancient secret: a flag encrypted within layers of obfuscation and virtual machine instructions. No one knows how deep the rabbit hole goes. Each byte of its payload is twisted by logic not meant to be understood — unless you can walk the same path as its creator.

You have been chosen to descend into the binary labyrinth. There are no breadcrumbs, only riddles. Your only tools: your debugger, your wit, and a strange file named `payload.dat`.

Decrypt the byte. Break the VM. Escape the labyrinth.

Note: You may need to bypass anti-debugging mechanisms. No source code will be provided — only the binary.

Good luck, reverse engineer.
