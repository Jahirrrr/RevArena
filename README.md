# 🧠 RevArena CTF

**RevArena** is the battlefield for those who speak in opcodes and dream in assembly.  
In this arena, you won’t just solve puzzles—you’ll dive deep into custom virtual machines,  
obscure logic, anti-debug traps, and binary layers wrapped in mystery.

---

## 🧩 What You'll Face

- Custom-built virtual machines
- Packed binaries with anti-debugging techniques
- Obfuscated control flow and logic bombs
- Heap mischief, syscall tricks, and hook injections

---

## 🎯 Objective

Uncover hidden flags using techniques like:
- Reverse Engineering
- Static Analysis & Disassembly
- Dynamic Debugging
- VM Logic Emulation

---

> There's no source code. No walkthrough.  
> Only your mind, your tools, and your patience.

Enter **RevArena** — and prove you’re worthy of the *Reverse Master* title.
